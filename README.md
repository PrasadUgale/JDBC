## 1: Introduction to JDBC
### What is JDBC?
Definition and purpose of JDBC in Java.
How JDBC acts as a bridge between Java applications and databases.
The architecture of JDBC (Drivers, Connection, Statement, etc.).
JDBC API Overview
Introduce core interfaces: Driver, Connection, Statement, PreparedStatement, CallableStatement, ResultSet.

## 2: Setting Up JDBC
### JDBC Drivers
Types of JDBC drivers (Type 1, 2, 3, and 4).
Downloading and setting up the MySQL JDBC driver (mysql-connector-java).
Loading and registering the driver using Class.forName() or DriverManager.registerDriver().
Connecting to a Database
The DriverManager class and connection URLs.
Create a simple Java program to connect to MySQL. Example: How to connect using the connection URL (jdbc:mysql://host:port/db_name).

## 3: Basic Database Operations
### Executing SQL Statements
Using Statement to execute simple SQL queries (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
How to handle SQL exceptions and clean up resources (finally block, try-with-resources).
Using PreparedStatements
Difference between Statement and PreparedStatement.
How PreparedStatement prevents SQL injection.
Executing parameterized queries using PreparedStatement.

## 4: Retrieving Data from the Database
### Working with ResultSet
How to use ResultSet to retrieve query results.
Looping through rows of a ResultSet and extracting data.
Column types and methods (getString(), getInt(), etc.).
Using ResultSetMetaData
How to retrieve metadata about the result set (column count, names, types).
Practical examples of using ResultSetMetaData.

## 5: Advanced Queries and Transactions
### Batch Processing in JDBC
How to execute multiple SQL queries at once using batch processing.
When and why batch updates are useful.
Stored Procedures with CallableStatements
Introduction to stored procedures in MySQL.
How to call stored procedures from Java using CallableStatement.
Handling IN, OUT, and INOUT parameters in stored procedures.
Transaction Management
Introduction to transactions (ACID properties).
Managing transactions in JDBC (commit, rollback).
Using Savepoints for partial rollbacks.

## 6: Handling Large Data Types
### BLOB and CLOB Handling
What are BLOB (binary large objects) and CLOB (character large objects)?
How to store and retrieve large data (images, text files) using JDBC.

## 7: Connection Pooling
### Introduction to DataSource
What is DataSource and how is it different from DriverManager?
How connection pooling works and why it's beneficial.
Setting up connection pooling with libraries like Apache DBCP or HikariCP.

## 8: JDBC API Extensions and Event Handling
### RowSet and Subclasses
What is RowSet, and how does it differ from ResultSet?
Overview of JdbcRowSet, CachedRowSet, and their uses.
JDBC Event Listeners
Event-driven programming in JDBC (ConnectionEventListener, StatementEventListener).

## 9: Database Metadata and Optimizations
### DatabaseMetaData
How to use DatabaseMetaData to retrieve database-specific information.
Practical examples (fetching database name, version, table names).
ResultSet Types and Concurrency
Different types of ResultSets (TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY, TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE, TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE).
ResultSet concurrency modes (CONCUR_READ_ONLY, CONCUR_UPDATABLE).

## 10: Best Practices and Error Handling
### Error Handling in JDBC
How to handle SQL exceptions properly (SQLException hierarchy).
Use of custom error messages and logging.
Best Practices
Avoid common pitfalls (resource leaks, SQL injection).
Use try-with-resources to automatically close JDBC resources.
Efficient batch processing and transaction management.
